# OGC Testbed-19 resources

Demonstration project for OGC TestBed 19 tasks D001 and D002 â€” Geospatial in space Engineering Reports.
For executing the demo application, a branch of [Apache SIS](http://sis.apache.org) most be built locally with Gradle.
No binary are deployed at this time, because the Testbed 19 experiment requires extensions that are not yet approved as OGC standards.
A future version of Apache SIS may incorporate those extensions (in which case local build will no longer be necessary)
if they become approved OGC standards.

* OGC 23-042 Engineering Report
* OGC 23-028 Engineering Report
* [Testbed-19 branch of Apache SIS](https://geomatys.github.io/testbed/19.html) (required for demo execution)
