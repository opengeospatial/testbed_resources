# OGC Testbed-19 data

Chain of coordinate operations encoded in GML.
Some GML files in this directory requires the
[standard schema proposal](https://github.com/opengeospatial/testbed_resources/tree/main/Testbed-19/space/standard-schema-proposal).
See [Testbed 19 demo application](https://geomatys.github.io/testbed/19.html)
for executing a coordinate transformation using the operations described in those GML files.
